# HR-Analytics-Dashboard
The HR Analytics Dashboard is an advanced data visualization project built using Power BI to help organizations analyze workforce data and make informed human resource decisions. It provides a detailed view of various HR performance indicators such as employee attrition rate, headcount, average age, salary distribution, gender diversity, and job satisfaction levels. By transforming raw HR data into meaningful insights, the dashboard supports strategic workforce planning and employee retention initiatives.

The primary objective of this dashboard is to identify patterns and factors contributing to employee attrition, which is a critical challenge for most organizations. Using interactive visuals, the dashboard highlights the departments, job roles, and demographics most affected by attrition. It also displays key performance indicators (KPIs) like total employees, total attrition, active employees, and attrition percentage through Power BI cards. This helps HR teams monitor workforce trends at a glance.

Various visual elements such as bar charts, donut charts, line graphs, and clustered columns are used to represent complex HR data in a clear and insightful way. For instance, department-wise bar charts show how attrition differs across teams, while donut charts display the gender and education distribution of employees. Line graphs help track monthly or yearly attrition trends, providing a time-based understanding of employee turnover.

The dashboard is powered by DAX calculations and efficient data modeling, allowing users to interact with data using filters like department, gender, education field, and job role. These interactive capabilities make it easy for HR managers to dive deeper into the causes of attrition and analyze relationships between different HR metrics.

Total employee count and attrition analysis

Department-wise and gender-wise attrition patterns
